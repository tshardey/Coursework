## Course Description
C++ is a general purpose programming language that supports various computer programming models such as object-oriented programming 
and generic programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup and, “Its main purpose was to make writing good programs easier 
and more pleasant for the individual programmer.”* By learning C++, you can create applications that will run on a wide variety of 
hardware platforms such as personal computers running Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Mac OS X, as well as small form factor hardware 
such as IoT devices like the Raspberry PI and Arduino–based boards.
